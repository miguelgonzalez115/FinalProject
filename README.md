# FinalProject
My final project for  PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS (CS-1400-001)

1. Overview and reflection
Well, my final project from the beginning was always to do something related to an inventory. To be able to modify it, add items and save it in a .txt or .csv document. And finally I got it, everything can be done from the console and I feel very satisfied with the work I did.

My project is interesting because as Proffessor Lewellen said, it is a useful program that to this day is used in some companies for its effectiveness, simplicity and ease of use.

One of the last part I did that I had trouble with was, when editing an item that already had the same name, use a simple number solution to choose the correct one.

This project helped me to learn and put into practice all the theory learned both in the book and in the classroom. I am happy to be able to advance my learning and to be able to use these tools in the future.
